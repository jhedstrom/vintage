A proof-of-concept for harvesting all
[drush make](http://github.com/drush-ops/drush) for all of a user's
(or organization's) repositories. The idea is that these would then be
aggregated into useful data to determine which projects have security
updates. Or which patches one has used in the past year. Or more.
